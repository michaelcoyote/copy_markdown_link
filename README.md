# Copy Markdown Link


Simply copy the page link or links as Markdown-formatted link to the clipboard.

There are 3 options:

1. Copy page link as Markdown-formatted link to the clipboard.
2. Copy all page titles in the current tab group as a list of Markdown-formatted links to the clipboard.
  - Note: This option is available only when the current tab is in a tab group.
3. Copy all page titles in current window as a list of Markdown-formatted links to the clipboard.

### Application ID
I programmatically created the application ID using the following command. 
```
$ python3 -m uuid -u uuid5 -n@x500 -N"CN='michael thomas guldan',applicationProcess=copy_markdown_link"
fbe023b1-0615-5250-b8b2-f7d9719eb69c
```
